      answer: 'Yes, ProvaDent is formulated with natural ingredients and beneficial probiotics that are designed for daily use. It\'s made in certified facilities following strict quality standards. As with any supplement, if you have specific health concerns or conditions, we recommend consulting with your healthcare provider.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long before I see results?',
      answer: 'Many users report noticing improvements in breath freshness within the first few weeks of consistent use. For optimal support of your oral microbiome and overall oral health, we recommend using ProvaDent daily for at least 60-90 days.

      question: 'Does it replace brushing and flossing?',
      answer: 'No, ProvaDent is designed to complement your existing oral hygiene routine, not replace it. Continue brushing twice daily and flossing regularly.

      question: 'How do I take ProvaDent?',
      answer: 'Simply take one tablet daily, preferably at the same time each day. You can take it with or without food. For best results, allow the tablet to dissolve slowly in your mouth or chew it thoroughly before swallowing to maximize contact with your oral tissues.'
